## Origin
The idea of the "Open Source Hub" (OSH) came to me after I realised that many really good ideas/project were deeply buried and/or underused.
So I decided to built something...

## Goal & Ideas
I'm building a hub to bring to the spotlight great ideas/project, to help them with the help of the community
I'm also building a giant network  composed of linked open-source project to greatly improve the experience of the users, of the devs and make open-source a reaaly viable options to mainstream proprietary solutions
