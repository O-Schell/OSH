Hi there, I'm <a href="https://github.com/O-Schell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">O'Schell</a> and welcome to the ðŸ‘‹

the central hub of open source !

### Idea
The main idea: bring together open source to build the best environnement for users and devs
The method: 
- Create a network of strong links (integrations, links, etc...) between already existing and popular projects to encourage users to use these projects and facilate the life of those who already use them
- Bring to spotlight creative & ingenious active projects burried deep. Supporting & integrating them into the network
- Make a hub system to provide a place with all the informations/data/links/etc on  

## Origin
The idea of the OSH came to me after I realised 2 things :
- That many really good ideas/project were deeply buried and/or underused.
- There isn't any connections between open-source software while it's a big reason of the sucess of proprietary environnements
- 
Faced these facts, I couldn't stay arms folded...

##
This readme is my first step. I'm now building a website to promote projects that need spotlight
Here are the things that are needed to be done. (Your help would help a lot !)
- Building & maintaning integrations between projects
- Building & maintaning the website
- Help projects with advice, code and monney if needed
- Searching through L4D (left for dead) projects and forking, upgrading and maintaning them
