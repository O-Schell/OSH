Hi there, I'm <a href="https://github.com/O-Schell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">O'Schell</a> and welcome to the ðŸ‘‹

<h1 align="center">
<a href="https://Open-Source-Hub.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Open Source Hub  !</a>
</h1> 
<h4 align="center">
the central hub of open source !
</h4> 

### Idea
Main idea: bring together open source to build the best environnement for users and devs

Method: 
- Create a network of strong links (integrations, links, etc...) between already existing and popular projects amoung the community to encourage new users to use these projects 
- Bring to spotlight creative & ingenious active projects burried deep, and if needed, supporting & integrating them into the network
- Make a hub system to provide a place with informations/data/links/etc related to OS

## Origin
The idea of the OSH came to me after I realised 2 things :
- That many really good ideas/project were deeply buried and/or underused.
- There isn't any connections between open-source software while it's a big reason of the sucess of proprietary environnements
- UI/UX is a very big problem in softwares of the OS community
- I can't stay with softwares design against me,  that hide some data (even MINE !) and won't let me export data in pratical ways, that I cannot improve nor personnalize and most all, are limited possibilities, creativity and ingenuity to maximize profit. 

Faced these facts, I couldn't stay arms folded...

##
This readme is my first step. I'm now building a website to promote projects that need spotlight
Here are the things that are needed to be done. (Your help would help a lot !)
- Building & maintaning integrations between projects
- Building & maintaning the website
- Help projects with advice, code and monney if needed
- Searching through L4D (left for dead) projects and forking, upgrading and maintaning them
